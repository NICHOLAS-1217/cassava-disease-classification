results indicate that masked images containing a maximum of
three leaves (M3) yield the most significant improvement in
disease classification performance, with an increase of approximately 2.13% to 3.06% in accuracy score. Thus, the proposed
method effectively extracts local information while mitigating
the impact of background complexity, enabling the model
to learn more robust class-discriminative features. The leaf
annotations can be a valuable resource for a",,90.64
