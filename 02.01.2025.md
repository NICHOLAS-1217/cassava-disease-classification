In remote sensing, it is common to design and use sensors which are sensitive to different spectral wavelengths than the visible spectrum. These types of sensors can be qualified as multispectral or hyperspectral, depending on the spectral resolution. Multispectral cameras usually have the usual RGB channels, and a few other spectral bands. The additional spectral bands will be selected in function of the phenonema that we want to observe. For example, in the case of plants, it has been demonstrated that plant health can be evaluated using the [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index). Due to these sensors being highly specific, ==methods have been developed to highlight green vegetation in imagery from widely-used RGB cameras==. By using such vegetation indices for RGB images and an ==Otsu thresholding method==, the vegetation can be extracted from RGB images purely by solely using "traditional" image processing methods.

The three main objective of this notebook are:
- Use two of the best performing vegetation indices for RGB images mentioned in [this recent paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11119-020-09735-1).
- Try to train a fully-convolutional Unet by filtering the vegetation in images using the best vegetation index. Once the groundtruth is extracted, we can apply advanced data augmentation techniques on the images of healthy plants to mimic diseases. We proceed this way as diseases will lead to diverse leaf coloration types that will negatively impact our vegetation indices. Therefore, we might obtain a more robust model that also segmentates diseased leaves correctly, where vegetation indices cannot.
- Open the conversation around the use of vegetation indices for disease classification, and whether they can actually help. As some other deep learning models have been improved thanks to preprocessing (e.g. [automatic color equilization in medical imagery problems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9162010)), I have good hopes something can be done here too!
